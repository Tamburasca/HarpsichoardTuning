# Harpsichord Tuning

A tuning tool for string instruments, such as harpsichords and pianos. First experiments published here. We need to test 
with pianos, they have less partials than harpsichords. 

Collects a mono audio signal from an input stream. The audio signal runs through a FFT with a Hanning apodization,
subsequently Gauss smoothing and Butterworth high-pass filtering is applied. The resulting spectrum is cross-correlated
with a theoretical overtone spectrum for strings. The result of the cross-correlation is maximized. Inharmonicity of 
strings is considered here through following equation

f<sub>n</sub> = n * f<sub>0</sub> * sqrt(1 + B * n<sup>2</sup>)

where n = 1, 2, 3, ... and B is the inharmonicity coefficient.
 
The first partial f<sub>1</sub> is compared with a tuning table, currently comprising solely Werkmeister III, 
1/4 Comma Meantone, and Equal Temperament (feel free to enhance for yourself). The deviation in units of cent is 
shown in the frequency plot, too low (in red), too high (in green).

Due to the low resolution of about 0.5 Hz/channel, the determination of inharmonicity coefficient 
seems somewhat difficult.
In order to achieve higher resolution the sampling interval needs to be enlarged, e.g. by pressing ctrl-k. However, that 
hampers the usability of this tool. Owing to the higher partials measured with this code, a determination of the inharmonicity coefficient appears feasible, though.

The hotkeys ctrl-y and ctrl-x exits and stops the program, respectively, ESC to resume. ctrl-j and ctrl-k shorten
and lengthen the recording interval within small ranges, whereas ctrl-n and ctrl-m diminish and increase the maximum 
frequency displayed in the lower frequency plot.

On UNIX OS please consider to run the package with sudo rights: sudo python3 -m Tuning, owing to particularity 
of the keyboard module.

We are still in the process to improving this tool in the course of time.
