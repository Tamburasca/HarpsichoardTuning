# Harpsichord Tuning

An automatic tuning tool for string instruments, mainly harpsichords and 
pianos. Tests are needed with pianos, owing to the larger inharmonicity 
factor.

Collects a mono audio signal from the input stream. The signal 
runs through a FFT with a Hanning apodization in the time domain. 
Subsequently, in the frequency domain, Butterworth high-pass filtering 
is applied before resonance frequencies are sought utilizing FIND_PEAKS of
scipy.signal. In order to achieve higher accuracy in their 
positions, the peaks found are fit to a Gaussian curve. The center
frequency are the peak positions further utilized in the calculations.

For an ideal string the frequencies of the higher partials are just multiples
of the fundamental

<em>f<sub>n</sub> = n * f<sub>1</sub> </em> (eq.1)

However, a real string behaves more like a stiff bar. Its partials 
can be approximated by

<em>f<sub>n</sub> = n * f<sub>0</sub> * sqrt(1 + B * n<sup>2</sup>)</em> (eq.2)

with n = 1, 2, 3, ... B and f<sub>0</sub> as the inharmonicity coefficient and 
base frequency, respectively.

All peak positions found are correlated to each other, such that they 
can be identifed as partials to one common base frequency. 
By rewriting (eq.2), we get, for all permutations of two frequencies

<em>B = ((f<sub>j</sub> * n<sub>i</sub> / f<sub>i</sub> * n<sub>j</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - 1) / 
(n<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup> - (f<sub>j</sub> * n<sub>i</sub> / f<sub>i</sub> * n<sub>j</sub>)<sup>2</sup> * 
n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> </em>) (eq.3)

<em>f<sub>0</sub> = f<sub>i</sub> / (n<sub>i</sub> * 
sqrt(1 + B * n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>))</em> (eq.4)

The measured frequencies and their partials are denoted 
<em>f<sub>i</sub> < f<sub>j</sub></em> and 
<em>n<sub>i</sub> < n<sub>j</sub> &#8804; NPARTIAL</em>. 
The maximum inharmonicity coefficient needs to be adjusted, depending on 
the instrument to be tuned, B < 0.001 and < 0.05 for harpsichords and 
pianos, respectively 
[parameters.py](https://github.com/Tamburasca/HarpsichordTuning/blob/master/Tuning/parameters.py).
 
The frequency of the first partial f<sub>1</sub> is compared to a value
derived from the pitch level and a tuning table 
[tuningTable.py](https://github.com/Tamburasca/HarpsichordTuning/blob/master/Tuning/tuningTable.py), 
currently comprising solely Werkmeister III, 
1/4 Comma Meantone, and Equal Temperament (feel free to edit/enhance it 
for yourself). The text in the second subplot shows the key's deviation,
in units of cent, for the specified tuning and pitch level: too low (in red) 
and too high (in green).

The upper plot represents the audio signal in the time domain, whereas the lower
represents its Fourier transform to the frequency domain. The orange 
vertical bars indicate the peaks that were identified by peak finding 
and located by their frequencies. The red vertical bars show the partials up to 
<em>n<sub>max</sub> &#8804; NPARTIAL</em> as 
derived from the computed base frequency and inharmonicity coefficient applying
(eq.2)

The hotkeys ctrl-y and ctrl-x exits and stops the program, respectively, 
ESC to resume. ctrl-j and ctrl-k shorten and lengthen the recording 
interval, whereas ctrl-n and ctrl-m diminish and 
increase the maximum frequency displayed in the lower frequency plot. The time
series in the upper subplot can be toggled off/on by pressing ctrl-v.

On certain Linux distributions, a package named python-tk (or similar) needs 
to be installed, when running in virtual environments.

Also note that the module pynput utilized here may encounter 
[plattform limitations](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html#)

Run the program with: <em>python3 -m Tuning</em>
