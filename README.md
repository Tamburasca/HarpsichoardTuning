# Harpsichord Tuning

An automatic tuning tool for string instruments, mainly harpsichords and 
pianos. Tests are still needed with pianos, owing to the larger inharmonicity 
factor.

Collects a mono audio signal from the input stream, splits it into smaller, 
overlapping slices, and applies the Fourier transform to each 
(known as the short time Fourier transform). The slices have a size of 
2<sup>N</sup> samples, where N is 15 or 16, and they overlap by multiples 
of 1024 samples. A Hanning window is multiplied with the audio signal in 
each slice. 
Subsequently, in the frequency domain, Butterworth high-pass filtering 
is applied to suppress noise from low frequencies before the fundamental and 
overtone frequencies are sought. In order to achieve
higher accuracy in their positions, we fit a Gaussian to the peaks found. 
Their centroids are utilized in the 
derivation of the fundamental frequency and the inharmonicity factor.

For an ideal string the frequencies of higher partials are just multiples
of the fundamental frequency

**(1) <em>f<sub>n</sub> = n * f<sub>1</sub> </em>**, 

where n = 1, 2, 3, ... The ear hears the fundamental frequency most prominently, but the overall 
sound is also colored by the presence of various overtones (frequencies greater 
than the fundamental frequency).

However, a real string behaves more like a 
stiff bar. Its partials can be approximated by

**(2) <em>f<sub>n</sub> = n * f<sub>0</sub> * sqrt(1 + B * n<sup>2</sup>)</em>**

B and f<sub>0</sub> are the inharmonicity coefficient 
and base frequency, respectively. 

All peak positions found are correlated to each other, such that they 
can be identifed as higher partials to one common base frequency f<sub>0</sub>. 
By rewriting (2), we get, for all permutations of two frequencies

**(3) <em>B = (C - 1) (n<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup> - C * 
n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)</em>**, 
where 
**<em>C = (f<sub>j</sub> * n<sub>i</sub> / f<sub>i</sub> * n<sub>j</sub>)
<sup>2</sup></em>**

**(4) <em>f<sub>0</sub> = f<sub>i</sub> / (n<sub>i</sub> *
sqrt(1 + B * n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>))</em>**

The measured frequencies and their partials are denoted 
<em>f<sub>i</sub> < f<sub>j</sub></em> and 1 &#8804;
<em>n<sub>i</sub> < n<sub>j</sub> &#8804; NPARTIAL</em>. 
The maximum inharmonicity coefficient needs to be adjusted in
[parameters.py](https://github.com/Tamburasca/HarpsichordTuning/blob/master/Tuning/parameters.py), 
depending on the instrument to be tuned, B < 0.001 and < 0.05 for 
harpsichords and pianos, respectively.

The frequency of the first partial f<sub>1</sub> (fundamental) is 
compared to a value derived from the pitch level and a tuning table 
[tuningTable.py](https://github.com/Tamburasca/HarpsichordTuning/blob/master/Tuning/tuningTable.py), 
currently comprising Werkmeister III, 
1/4 Comma Meantone, and Equal Temperament (feel free to edit/enhance it 
for yourself). The text in the plot shows the key's deviation,
in units of cent, for the specified tuning and pitch level: too low (in red) 
and too high (in green).

The orange vertical bars indicate the peaks identified by the peak 
finding routine. The red vertical bars show the partials up to 
<em>n<sub>max</sub> &#8804; NPARTIAL</em> as 
derived from the computed base frequency and inharmonicity coefficient 
when applying (2).

The hotkeys ctrl-y and ctrl-x exits and stops the program, respectively, 
ESC to resume. ctrl-j and ctrl-k shorten and lengthen the slices shift, 
whereas ctrl-n and ctrl-m diminish and increase the maximum frequency 
displayed.

On certain Linux distributions, a package named python-tk (or similar) needs 
to be installed, when running in virtual environments.

Also note that the module pynput utilized here may encounter 
[plattform limitations](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html#)

Run the program with: <em>python3 -m Tuning</em>
